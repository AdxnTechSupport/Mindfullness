    </p>

    <h1>Basic Needs</h1>

    <p>
        Being Social:
        Socailising is incredibly important to maintaining good mental wellbeing, especially in a post-Covid era. Being social allows you to
        make connections which in turn makgives you a sense of belonging. Being around others gives you a chance to recieve emotional
        support and it also allows you to help others who need it. 
    </p>

    <h1> Academic Stress: </h1>
        <p>
            This is something that you are going to deal with alot throughout your time at post-secondary, so it's best that you
            know how to effectively manage it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Plan Ahead:
            Knowing when a test is or when an assignment is due can save you a lot of trouble! Putting all of the dates of tests and when assignments are due
            can give you a good overview of what needs to be done first. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Don't fall Behind:
            Falling behind in a class is something that you do want to happen during post-secondary. Falling behind makes it difficult to understand what is happening
            during the current lecture as well as the future lectures. Becuase they were designed with the idea that you already understand the ideas that were 
            taught in the previous lectures. You can get help by reaching out to your instructor to go over a concept that you find difficult, but it is important to 
            understand these topics so that you can understand ones in the future. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Speak to Someone:
            Some post-secondary institutions provide consuling for their students, this is a great place for you to talk about how you fell and to get help while on campus.
            If what you are dealing with is an academic matter, ask your instructors for help and clarification or go to peer tutoring sessions.
        </p>
        
        
        <h1>Study Techniques</h1>
        
        <p>Pomdoro Technique: 
            The Pomodoro technique spaces out work into short periods of time (ex. 25 mins). The idea
            is to focus during the short periods of time and to take 2 - 5 minuts breaks after the work period is over.
            The technique works as follows:
        </p>

        <p> 1. Choose something that you want to focus on. </p>
        <p> 2. Set your a timer to your desired time period.</p>
        <p >3. Focus until the timer goes off.</p>
        <p> 4. Take a short break.</p>
        <p> 5. After 4 of these "focus periods" (AKA Pomodoros), take a longer break.</p>


        <p>Feynman Technique:
            This study technique is based on the idea that if you want to understand a concept, you try to teach it.
        </p>
            
            <p>1. Choose the concept that you want to udersatand.</p>
            <p>2. Write down everyting that you know about the topic.</p>
            <p>3. Try to explain the concept in a simple manner, as if you were teaching someone who has no knowledge on the subject.</p>
            <p>4. Go back to what you wrote and see if you awere corret and if there were plpaces you neeeded to improve.</p>
            <p>5. If there was anything that could be broken down into more simple language, go back and rewrite these parts.</p>
